What you will find in our repository:
1. **Homework_5.ipynb**: a tidy Notebook where we put the code and the comments of our pipeline;
2. A folder named **File** with inside:
    - `sdnodes.zip`: contains all the edges among the nodes belonging to the thirty-five categories (these categories have more than 3500 articles);
    - `new_cat_data.pickle`: contains the block-ranking;
    - `subgraph.pickle`: contains a dictionary in which there are the weight associated with each node in each category;
    - `ranking.csv`: contains the ranking; that is we find each article with its own name.
